Slice Application
=================

Splice is an application that will concatenate files into a single file using files that were created by the slice application (<https://github.com/winterplexus/slice/>).

The input file directory must contain files with a base name containing a period and a sequence number (4 digits with leading zeroes); the sequence number must begin at 0001.

The application is written in the C language for both Windows and Linux operating systems.
